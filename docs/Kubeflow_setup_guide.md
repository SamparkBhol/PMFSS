# Kubeflow Setup Guide

## Introduction

Kubeflow is a powerful tool for deploying, managing, and scaling machine learning models in a Kubernetes environment. This guide will help you set up Kubeflow to deploy the predictive maintenance model for space stations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running. You can set this up using services like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon EKS.
2. **Kubectl**: Install `kubectl`, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
3. **Kustomize**: Install `kustomize` to manage the Kubernetes manifests.

## Step 1: Install Kubeflow

1. Clone the Kubeflow manifests repository:
   git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests.git
   cd manifests

2. Customize your deployment:
   kustomize build .

3. Deploy Kubeflow:
   kubectl apply -k .

4. Verify the deployment:
   kubectl get pods -n kubeflow
   You should see several pods in a running state.

## Step 2: Access the Kubeflow Dashboard

1. Forward the port to access the dashboard:
   kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80

2. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Kubeflow dashboard.

## Step 3: Deploy the XGBoost Model

1. Create a pipeline YAML file:
   vim kubeflow_pipeline.yaml
   Refer to the `pipelines/kubeflow_pipeline.py` file for the pipeline structure.

2. Apply the pipeline:
   kubectl apply -f kubeflow_pipeline.yaml

3. Monitor the pipeline run in the Kubeflow dashboard.

## Step 4: Scale with H2O.ai

1. Install the H2O Kubernetes operator:
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-kubernetes/releases/download/v0.1.5/h2o-operator.yaml

2. Deploy the model on H2O:
   kubectl apply -f h2o_scaling.yaml
   Refer to the `pipelines/h2o_scaling.py` file for scaling configurations.

3. Monitor scaling activities through the H2O dashboard.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you've successfully set up Kubeflow and deployed the predictive maintenance model. You can now monitor the model's performance and adjust scaling as necessary using H2O.ai.
