# Gradio Integration Guide

## Introduction

Gradio is a powerful tool for creating interactive user interfaces for machine learning models. This guide will walk you through integrating Gradio into your predictive maintenance system for space stations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have Python installed.
2. **Gradio Library**: Install Gradio using pip:
   pip install gradio

## Step 1: Create the Gradio Interface

1. Navigate to the `dashboard/gradio_interface.py` file. This script sets up the Gradio interface to interact with the predictive maintenance model.

2. Review the interface structure:
   - The interface includes inputs for various system metrics (e.g., temperature, pressure).
   - Outputs include the predicted probability of system failure and suggested maintenance actions.

3. Run the script to launch the Gradio interface:
   python gradio_interface.py

4. The interface will be available at `http://localhost:7860`.

## Step 2: Customize the Interface

1. Customize the inputs:
   - You can modify the inputs to include any relevant features from the space station monitoring system.
   - Adjust the range and type of input components as needed.

2. Customize the outputs:
   - Modify the output to display additional information like feature importance, model confidence, etc.
   - Use Gradioâ€™s `plot` component to visualize feature contributions.

## Step 3: Integrate Alerts

1. Navigate to the `dashboard/alerts.py` file. This script monitors the model's predictions and triggers alerts when necessary.

2. Customize alert thresholds:
   - Set thresholds based on historical data or expert input to determine when to trigger an alert.
   - The script is configured to send email notifications for critical alerts.

3. Run the alerting system:
   python alerts.py

4. The system will monitor predictions in real-time and send alerts when necessary.

## Step 4: Deploy the Gradio Interface

1. Deploy the Gradio interface using a web server (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) if you need to serve it to multiple users.

2. Integrate with your existing monitoring systems for seamless operation.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've integrated a Gradio-based interactive dashboard into your predictive maintenance system. This allows space station operators to monitor system health in real-time and receive timely alerts for potential failures.
