# üöÄ Predictive Maintenance for Space Stations

Welcome to the **Predictive Maintenance for Space Stations** project! This repository contains everything you need to deploy a cutting-edge predictive maintenance system using XGBoost, Kubeflow, and H2O.ai, along with a Gradio-powered dashboard for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

In space, the stakes are high. A single failure can jeopardize entire missions and put lives at risk. This project is my solution to that challenge. I‚Äôve developed a system that predicts potential failures on space stations before they happen, giving operators time to intervene.

## üåå Why This Project Is Necessary

As someone deeply passionate about both space technology and artificial intelligence, I embarked on this project with a strong sense of purpose. Space is an incredibly challenging environment where every piece of technology must function flawlessly to ensure the safety and success of missions. The stakes are high, and even a minor failure can have serious consequences. Having a robust predictive maintenance system in place is crucial for space stations. It allows us to anticipate potential issues before they become critical, giving operators the opportunity to address problems proactively. This not only enhances the safety and reliability of space missions but also helps in minimizing costly downtime and extending the lifespan of expensive equipment. My passion for space tech and AI/ML drove me to develop this system. I've always been fascinated by the idea of using advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, especially in such an extraordinary and demanding field. By combining XGBoost with Kubeflow and H2O.ai, I've aimed to create a predictive model that is both accurate and scalable. The integration of Gradio for real-time monitoring adds an extra layer of accessibility and user-friendliness, ensuring that the system is practical and easy to use. _This project is more than just a technical challenge for me_ ‚Äî it's a step towards making space exploration safer and more efficient. I hope it inspires others to explore the intersection of AI and space technology and to push the boundaries of what we can achieve with these cutting-edge tools. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a future where space missions are not only more successful but also more sustainable and resilient. The journey of creating this system has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm excited to see how it can make a difference in the world of space exploration.
