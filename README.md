# 🚀 Predictive Maintenance for Space Stations

Welcome to the **Predictive Maintenance for Space Stations** project! This repository contains everything you need to deploy a cutting-edge predictive maintenance system using XGBoost, Kubeflow, and H2O.ai, along with a Gradio-powered dashboard for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

In space, the stakes are high. A single failure can jeopardize entire missions and put lives at risk. This project is my solution to that challenge. I’ve developed a system that predicts potential failures on space stations before they happen, giving operators time to intervene.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **XGBoost Model**: Leveraging gradient boosting to predict failures with high accuracy.
- **Kubeflow Deployment**: Ensuring the model is deployed in a scalable and robust manner using Kubeflow.
- **H2O.ai Integration**: Enhancing model performance and scalability by using H2O.ai.
- **Gradio Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring, with alerts for potential failures.

## 📂 Project Structure

Here’s a quick overview of how everything is organized:

- **config.yaml**: Configuration file with all the settings for the project.
- **main.py**: The entry point for running the entire predictive maintenance system.
- **models/**: Contains the XGBoost model and evaluation scripts.
- **pipelines/**: Kubeflow pipelines, including H2O scaling and deployment configuration.
- **dashboard/**: Code for the Gradio interface and alerting system.
- **scripts/**: Data preprocessing, feature importance, and other utility scripts.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests to ensure the system works flawlessly.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including setup guides and architecture diagrams.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining what the project is all about.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of dependencies to get everything up and running.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: First, I preprocess the data, cleaning it and preparing it for modeling.
2. **Model Training**: The XGBoost model is trained on historical data to predict potential failures.
3. **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed using Kubeflow, ensuring scalability and reliability.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The Gradio dashboard allows operators to monitor system health in real-time.
5. **Alerts**: If a potential failure is detected, an alert is triggered, giving operators time to take action.

## 🤖 Why This Project Is Cool

- **Space-Ready**: Designed with the unique challenges of space environments in mind.
- **Scalable**: The use of Kubeflow and H2O.ai ensures that the system can handle large-scale data in real-time.
- **User-Friendly**: The Gradio dashboard makes it easy for anyone to monitor the system and respond to alerts.
- **Cutting-Edge**: Combines advanced machine learning techniques with state-of-the-art deployment and monitoring tools.
